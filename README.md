## CS 122B Project 5 Scaling Fabflix

In this project, we are using JMeter to measure our search function. After using JMeter, TS and TJ will be writed into log file. We provide parse.py to calculate average time of TS and TJ.
In parse.py, there are two functions: non_scaled and scaled. Using for loop and reading line by line, we can calculate the average time. Remember to switch between scaled and non_scaled funtions according to which log file is being parsed. All of log files are put under Project5_Log_Graph folder.
