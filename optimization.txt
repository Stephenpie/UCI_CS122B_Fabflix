1. We first use naive method to parse the data and insert into tables.

2. Without checking for duplicate values, it was about 7 min.

3. After adding techniques to check for duplicate values, it takes over 15 min.

4. We use batch insert and use hashmap to store existing data in database.
   With such technique, inserting data to stars, genres, movies and genres_in_movies tables are super fast. 
   For stars and genres, it takes no longer than 3 seconds. 
   For movies and genres_in_movies, it takes about 88 seconds. 
   However, for inserting data into stars_in_movies table, it takes about 6 min to finish checking duplicates and inserting into stars and stars_in_movies.
